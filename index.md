You know and love [https://www.vm.ibm.com/](IBM z/VM)? Of course you do. 

Do you know how to lock it down? I can help.

This isn't the only z/VM security reference on the web -- I'm also in charge of the [https://www.vm.ibm.com](official z/VM security webpage), for example. 
But I'm carving out this space so I can fast-path hands-on content and how-to's directly to the folks who need it.
If you have any requests for topics, feel free to drop me a line.
